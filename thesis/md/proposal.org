* Introduction
Lactogenesis is the process of developing the ability to secrete milk and involves the maturation of alveolar cells[cite:@pillayPhysiologyLactation2022];
It takes place in 2 stages: secretory initiation (stage I) and secretory activation (stage II)[cite:@pillayPhysiologyLactation2022].
Stage II lactogenesis starts with copious milk production, usually, at days 2 or 3 postpartum[cite:@pillayPhysiologyLactation2022].

It is well established that mothers with insulin-resistant conditions such as pregestational and gestational diabetes, obesity, and polycystic ovary syndrome are at increased risk of delayed lactogenesis II and early cessation of breastfeeding[cite:@nommsen-riversDelayedOnsetLactogenesis2010;@nommsen-riversTimingStageII2012].
Women diagnosed with low milk supply were significantly more likely to have had diabetes in pregnancy compared with women with any other lactation difficulty[cite:@riddleCaseControlStudy2016].
A major contributor to excess newborn weight loss is delayed lactogenesis[cite:@chantryExcessWeightLoss2011].

Human milk is the optimal food for human infants, and provides many diverse and well described benefits for both mother and infant[cite:@riddleLowMilkSupply2017].
For the infant, formula feeding increases the risk of diabetes, obesity, infectious respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, and sudden infant death syndrome[cite:@riddleLowMilkSupply2017].
In mothers, early weaning or never breastfeeding is associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, diabetes, and hypertension[cite:@riddleLowMilkSupply2017].

Thus, we hypothesize that an intervention targeting insulin sensitivity may be effective in improving milk production in women with insulin-resistant conditions and delayed lactogenesis.

* Review of The Literature
A literature search with the string "low milk production AND (obes* OR metabolic syndrome OR insulin resistance) AND metformin" on <2022-11-06 Sun> in the Google Scholar, PubMed, and Cochrane library databases was performed[fn:1].
Full text of all documents reviewed thoroughly and carefully on <2022-11-07 Mon> to provide a research foundation in the topic.

Riddle and Nommsen-Rivers in a case-control study on 401 breastfeeding medicine clinic visits <90 days postpartum of women who were highly motivated to breastfed,
observed significantly greater odds of diabetes history in women with a low milk supply diagnosis compared with women with any other lactation difficulty[cite:@riddleCaseControlStudy2016].

In an animal study by Rolls and Rowe on Lister rats,
obese rats have difficulty initiating lactation;
during lactation, they exhibit low milk production associated with poor pup growth and high pup mortality rates[cite:@rollsPregnancyLactationObese1982].

According to a study by Thatcher and Jackson on 188 patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treated with metformin,
of those women attempted to breastfeed, 78% succeeded and **only 3% failed due to poor milk production**[cite:@thatcherPregnancyOutcomeInfertile2006];

[fn:1] Also, a literature search through SID, Civilica, and IranDoc with the Persian translation of the topic performed which didn't result in any enhancement.

* Research Gaps
As the literature review revealed, there is little established studies around the effect of metformin on different stages of lactogenesis.

* Research Design and Methods
In human clinical practice, it is difficult and maybe catastrophic for both mother and children to withhold an absolutely beneficial therapy like metformin from mothers with insulin resistance conditions[cite:@shubPregestationalDiabetesPregnancy2020;@buchananGestationalDiabetesMellitus2012].
Thus, a randomized controlled animal trial study is the most straightforward and valuable study to provide an evidence for causal inference of metformin and lactogenesis.

*/Animals./* Female Wistar rats (n=15) will be purchased and housed in a temperature-controlled, 12h light-dark cycle environment with ad libitum access to water and food.
Animal care and use will conform to institutional policies and guidelines.

*/Metabolic syndrome induction./* To induce the metabolic syndrome, all rats will be fed by a custom prepared high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (carbohydrate, 52%; fat, 24%, 25% fructose in drinking water).
By 16 weeks of feeding it will be expected the rats develop the metabolic syndrome[cite:@wongAnimalModelsMetabolic2016;@poudyalOliveLeafExtract2010;@poudyalComparisonPurpleCarrot2010;@panchalHighcarbohydrateHighfatDiet2011],
but due to the diet-dependent essence of the insulin resistance[cite:@wongAnimalModelsMetabolic2016],
to maintain the pathophysiological state, feeding will be continued during the entire course of the study.
All rats will undergo timed-mating to get pregnant following development of the metabolic syndrome, and non-obese rats will be excluded from the study.

*/Experimental groups./* Rats will randomly divide into three experimental groups including no treatment (control group), metformin treatment during pregnancy (P group), metformin treatment during pregnancy and lactation (PL group).

*/Intervention./* Metformin (Reyhaneh pharmaceutical company, Isfahan, Iran) film coated tablets will be dissolved in water and administrated as 500mg/kg by oral dosing.

*/Outcome measures./* The total weight of the litter suckled, at 12 days of age—before young rats open their eyes and begin to take solid food—as a convenient measure of milk production[cite:@falconerMilkProductionMice1947], will be measured using a sensitive calibrated weight scale.
Because food will be unlimited, the measurement of milk production gives no indication of the efficiency of the rat in converting food into milk[cite:@falconerMilkProductionMice1947].
To control litter size among mother rats, the size of all litters will reduce to the minimum achieved litter size and the excess will be excluded from the study.

*/Exclusion criteria./* Rats may be excluded from study if any of the following criteria are meet: 1. Death of the mother rat at any point of the study, regardless of the cause 2. Remaining non-obese after 16 weeks of the metabolic syndrome induction 3. Death of pup(s) regardless of the cause during lactation.

*/Limitations./* The metabolic syndrome classically and pathophysiologically defined as insulin resistance,
caused systematically by incompletely understood defect in insulin action, mainly on post-receptor signaling pathways[cite:@roberth.eckelMetabolicSyndrome].
Although increased fat mass (especially visceral fat) can decrease whole-body insulin sensitivity, neither obesity nor overfeeding doesn't seem to be the root cause of the syndrome[cite:@roberth.eckelMetabolicSyndrome].
The animal model proposed in this study not only is not a perfect model for such a complex polygenic multifactorial syndrome, but also has a completely reverse pathophysiology.

*/Statistical Analysis./* Data transformation methods will be used as needed; \alpha=0.05; An ANOVA test will be performed between experimental groups milk production to evaluate statistical difference.
